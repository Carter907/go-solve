Go solve is a programming practice website for golang. Solve basic programming problems with a wide breadth of different categorizations and difficulty. Problems are called tasks.

Go-solve was highly influenced by the coding practice website *CodingBat* which only supports Java and Python. Once this project is done, I plan to create a fork of it for other languages.

Golang was chosen for the creation of the server for it's simplicity and ease of use.
